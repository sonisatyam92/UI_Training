        ey didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
        Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met
        for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a
        sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were
        as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.  e Dursleys shuddered
        to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the
        street.  e Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but
        they had never even seen him.  is boy was another good reason
        for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with
        a child like that.
        When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday
        our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to
        suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening
        all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his
        most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily
        as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
        None of them noticed a large, tawny owl fl utter past the
        window.
        At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked
        Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but
        missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing
        his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left
        the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s
        drive.
        It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst sign
        of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr.
        Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head
        around to look again.  ere was a tabby cat standing on the corner

        have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr.
        Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley

        his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no,
        looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley
        gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he
        drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of
        drills he was hoping to get that day.

        Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met
        for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a
        sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were
        as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.  e Dursleys shuddered
        to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the
        street.  e Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but
        they had never even seen him.  is boy was another good reason
        for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with
        a child like that.
        When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday
        our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to
        suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening
        all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his
        most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily
        as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
        None of them noticed a large, tawny owl fl utter past the
        window.
        At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked
        Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but
        missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing
        his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left
        the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s
        drive.
        It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the fi rst sign
        of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr.
        Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head
        around to look again.  ere was a tabby cat standing on the corner

        have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr.
        Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
        drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in
        his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no,
        looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley
