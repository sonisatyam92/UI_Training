 Eager  : i will get all data then i will do it.

 Eg :
 Cooking :

 Cake :
 Break Base
 Cream Fillings
 Fruits

 First create cake base once completed
 cream filling ->  completed
 Fruits

 HTML
 i will not show anything till my all components are ready.
 User: see nothing


 Lazy : i start doing it, and i get data meanwhile to use it
  Start Baking Cake,
  Cream Filling -> Cooking
  Cut fruits

  HTML

   Render my page then
   meanwhile the other components will show.
